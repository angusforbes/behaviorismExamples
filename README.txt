Examples for current version of behaviorism... 

You'll need to link to the pre JogAmp version of JOGL2.0 natives as well as the JavaFX 1.2.1 version of JMC (if you are using the video examples). Also, these examples require that you point to the behaviorism.jar file in the current version of behaviorism.

Will add some documentation at some point, especially if anyone asks for it...
